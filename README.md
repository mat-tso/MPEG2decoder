# Yet another MPEG-2 Part 3 decoder
An attempt at an [MPEG-2 Part 3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MPEG-2_Part_3) decoder in Rust.

This is a toy project, use at your own risk!

## Supported layers
 - [ ] [Layer I] (MP1)
 - [ ] [Layer II] (MP2)
   + [ ] [Multichannel]
 - [ ] [Layer III] (MP3)

[Layer I]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MPEG-1_Audio_Layer_I
[Layer II]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MPEG-1_Audio_Layer_II
[Multichannel]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MPEG_Multichannel
[Layer III]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MPEG-1_Audio_Layer_III

## Roadmap
 1) [ ] Find a simple [reference implementation](#existing-implementations)
      + It should be in C and contain as few as possible assembly and no threading
      + It should have a compatible license
      + It should have a test suite
      + It should be simple to read and port (no assembly, no complex SIMD)
 2. [ ] Compile the reference implementation as submodule with Cargo
 3. [ ] Make the reference implementation callable from Rust ([C2Rust](https://github.com/immunant/c2rust)?)
 4. [ ] Reimplement each component and compare with reference implementation

Layer I being so simple, a reference implementation may not be needed.

## Personal goals
 - Learn Rust
 - Learn MP3 file format
 - Learn audio signal processing
 
## Safety goals
 - Use safe Rust as much as possible
 - No explicit panic
 
## Features
 - [ ] Dump MPEG-2 structure
 - [ ] Dump MPEG-2 packets
 - [ ] Output PCM
  
## Test goals
 - [ ] 100% test coverage
 - [ ] Compare struct dump to reference
 - [ ] Compare packets dump to reference
 - [ ] PCM output is identical to reference excluding rounding errors
 - [ ] Stretch: Assembly generated never calls `panic!`
 
 Reference should be generatable from `fmprobe` and `ffmpeg`.
